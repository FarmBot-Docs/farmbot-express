**FarmBot Express** is designed to be an affordable and easy-to-use FarmBot for those who want to get setup and running quickly and don't need all of the features and customization options available with [FarmBot Genesis](http://genesis.farm.bot). The driving factors behind the design are simplicity, ease-of-setup, and affordability.

FarmBot Express is available in two sizes: a standard sized model suitable for small yards, greenhouses, classrooms, and research labs; and an XL model suitable for families, larger spaces, multi-class school use, and larger scale R&D.
