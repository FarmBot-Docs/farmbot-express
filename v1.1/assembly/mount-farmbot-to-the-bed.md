# Step 1: Route the belts

Feed each end of the x-axis [[belts]] down through the center channels in the two [[gantry columns]]. Then route the belts under the [[idler pulleys]]. Ensure there are no twists inside the extrusions. The belt teeth should be facing down towards the bed.

# Step 2: Secure the belts

Secure both ends of each [[belt]] to a [[belt clip]] using a [[belt sleeve]] and the same method used when [securing the y-axis belt](attach-the-z-axis.md#step-3-attach-the-y-axis-belt). Then attach the belt clips to the **raised bed** using two [[wood screws]]. The belt clip tabs should be extending over the outside of the bed to serve as hardstops against the gantry wheel plates.

content="Overtightening the belts may result in the front wheels of the gantry lifting off of the raised bed. If you notice this, loosen the belts slightly so that the gantry rests and rolls on the bed with all four wheels."

# Step 3: Attach the x-axis cable carrier

Lay the **loaded x-axis cable carrier** onto the bed's **cable carrier support**. Fasten it to the bed with two [[wood screws]] and to the **cable carrier mount** with two [[M3 x 16mm flat head screws]] and [[M3 locknuts]].
