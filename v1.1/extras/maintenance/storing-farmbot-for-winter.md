While FarmBot is designed to be used and stored outdoors, you may want to bring it inside for the winter, or if an extreme weather event (such as a hurricane) is heading your way.

# Step 1: Move FarmBot into a storage position

Use the web app's **manual controls** to move the Y and Z axes to a suitable storage position. We recommend storing your FarmBot with the z-axis in a lowered position, and the cross-slide positioned near one of the gantry columns.

Move the X axis to one of the bed end locations. This will facilitate removing the gantry from the bed in Step 6.

# Step 2: Disconnect the water supply

Turn off the water supply to your FarmBot. Then unscrew the [[garden hose to barb adapter]] from the **garden hose**.

Using the web app, turn ON the water peripheral to open up the solenoid valve, allowing any remaining water in FarmBot's tubing to drain.

# Step 3: Unplug FarmBot

Using the web app, shutdown the FarmBot. Then unplug the [[power supply]] from the **power source**.

Disconnect the [[power supply]] from the [[power supply cable]].

# Step 4: Disconnect the x-axis cable carrier

Remove the **screws** that hold the **x-axis cable carrier** to the [[35mm cable carrier mount]]. You may want to coil up the x-axis cable carrier, and secure the coil with a strap.

# Step 5: Remove the x-axis belts

Remove the **screws** that hold the four [[belt clips]] located at the ends of the bed. Then coil up the loose belt length. Use twist ties or rubber bands to keep the belts coiled.

# Step 6: Remove the gantry from the bed

For Express sized devices, lift from the *center* of the [[gantry main beam]] to slowly remove the FarmBot from the bed.

For (XL) sized devices, you will need an additional person to help with this step. Each person should be positioned at a [[gantry column]] (one person on either side of the FarmBot). Lifting from the gantry columns, both people must work in unison to slowly remove the FarmBot from the bed.

# Step 7: Put everything in storage

Move the gantry, power supply, and any other hardware into your preferred storage location.
