# Copying and modifying parts

When you click any of the links above, you will be shown our original copy of the FarmBot CAD files. In order to make any changes, you need to make your own copy. To do so, you will need to first make a free Onshape account. Then you can press “Make a copy” in the top left of the Onshape workspace. Onshape will copy the entire Workspace into a new document (owned by you) which will include all of the parts, drawings, assemblies, and other files.

title="The default part studio opened might be unexpected"
content="When Onshape opens up your copy of the workspace, it might open a random Part Studio. To find and open another Part Studio in the Workspace, press the button in the lower left of the screen to open the Tab Manager. Then find the Part Studio you want by looking through the folders or using the search box at the top of the Tab Manager panel."

# Exporting parts

To export a part into another format (such as `.STL` for 3D printing), simply right-click the part and press "Export". Note that you will need an Onshape account to do this. However, you do not need to make a copy of the workspace in order to export.
