# Step 1: Route the belts

Feed each end of the **x-axis belts** down through the center channels in the two **gantry columns**. Then route the belts under the **idler pulleys**. Ensure there are no twists inside the extrusions. The belt teeth should be facing down towards the bed.

# Step 2: Secure the belts

Secure both ends of each **belt** to a **belt clip** using a **belt sleeve** and the same method used when [securing the y-axis belt](attach-the-z-axis.md#step-2-attach-the-y-axis-belt). Then attach the belt clips to the **raised bed** using two **wood screws**. The belt clip tabs should be extending over the outside of the bed to serve as hardstops against the gantry wheel plate.

# Step 3: Attach the x-axis cable carrier

Lay the **loaded x-axis cable carrier** onto the bed's **cable carrier support**. Fasten it to the bed with two **wood screws** and to the **cable carrier mount** with two **M5 x 16mm screws** and **M5 flange locknuts**.
