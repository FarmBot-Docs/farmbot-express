# Step 1: Attach the motor
Insert the **motor shaft** through the hole in the upper left of the **cross-slide plate** as shown. The motor connector should be facing down, towards the slot in the cross-slide plate.

Mount the **20 tooth GT2 pulley** onto the motor shaft, ensuring the setscrews are aligned with the flat parts of the shaft. There should be 1mm of space between the pulley and the cross-slide plate.

# Step 2: Attach the leadscrew block
Attach the **leadscrew block** to the **cross-slide plate** using two **M5 x 25mm screws** and two **M5 flange locknuts**. The leadscrew block should be on the same side of the plate as the motor.

# Step 3: Attach the cable carrier mount
Attach the **65mm cable carrier mount** to the **cross-slide plate** using two **M5 x 20mm screws** and two **M5 flange locknuts**. The mount should be on the same side of the plate as the pulley.

# Step 4: Attach the v-wheels with eccentric spacers
Attach three **v-wheels** to the **cross-slide plate** using **eccentric spacers**, **M5 x 30mm screws**, and **M5 flange locknuts**.
