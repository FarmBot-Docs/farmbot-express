# Step 1: Mount the vacuum pump
Attach the **vacuum pump mount** to the the **z-axis extrusion** using two **M5 x 16mm screws** and one **60mm nut bar**. The bottom of the mount should be 185mm from the bottom of the extrusion.

Securely tighten the **vacuum pump** onto the **vacuum pump mount** using two **200mm zip ties**. Cut off the excess zip tie material.

Press one of the **vacuum tubes** onto the inlet of the **vacuum pump**. Then press the **inline filter** onto the open end of the tube. Then press the second vacuum tube onto the open end of the inline filter.

# Step 2: Mount the cable carrier supports
Attach the four **40mm vertical cable carrier supports** to the **z-axis extrusion** using **M5 x 10mm screws** and **40mm nut bars**. The space between all supports should be 180mm.

# Step 3: Mount the motor
Attach the **z-axis motor mount** to the **z-axis extrusion** using two **M5 x 10mm screws** and one **60mm nut bar**. The recessed lip of the motor mount should be 60mm from the top of the extrusion.

![Screen Shot 2019-11-07 at 2.30.01 PM.png](Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_2.30.01_PM.png)

Position the **motor** on the mount with the motor's connector facing the extrusion. Then secure the motor in place with four **M3 x 12mm screws**.

# Step 4: Mount the cable carrier
Position the **loaded z-axis cable carrier** in the **cable carrier supports** such that the camera is located at the bottom of the extrusion. Secure the cable carrier to the **vertical cable carrier support** using two **M5 x 16mm screws** and **M5 flange locknuts**.

_Note: not all cables are shown_

# Step 5: Connect the z-axis motor cable
Feed the **z-axis motor cable** up through the slots in the four **cable carrier supports** and the slot in the **z-axis motor mount**. Then plug the cable into the **motor**.

# Step 6: Connect the vacuum pump cable
Feed the **vacuum pump cable** up through the slot in the first **cable carrier support** and then plug the connectors into the **vacuum pump's terminals**.


# Step 7: Mount the motor housing
Mount the **50mm vertical motor housing** using two **M5 x 10mm screws** and one **60mm nut bar**. The housing should fit snugly in the motor mount's recessed lip. The top of the motor housing should also be flush with the top of the extrusion, which may require a slight adjustment of the motor mount's position.

# Step 8: Attach the leadscrew
Insert the **leadscrew** fully into the **5mm to 8mm shaft coupler** and tighten the setscrews.

![Screen Shot 2019-11-07 at 2.56.01 PM.png](Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_2.56.01_PM.png)

Slide the **5mm to 8mm shaft coupler** onto the **motor shaft**, ensuring that the setscrews are aligned with the flat sides of the motor shaft. Ensure there is approximately 1-3mm of space between the end of the motor shaft and the end of the leadscrew - they should **not** be touching inside the coupler. Tighten the setscrews.
