# End piece orientation
Each cable carrier has two **end pieces** that are slightly different, and will come pre-mounted in a specific orientation from the manufacturer. This allows the cable carriers to be mounted onto the FarmBot in the correct orientation.

The cables must be inserted into the cable carriers in the correct orientation so that the connectors on each end can be plugged into the electronics board, motor, peripheral, etc.

The motor connector of the **z-axis motor cable (z-axis section)** will eventually be connected to the **z-axis motor**, by being routed up the z-axis through the vertical cable carrier supports. This part of the subassembly will happen later.
